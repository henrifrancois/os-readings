the vpn is used to determine the page table, where we'll use the pfn to determine the page

Larger pages imply that the TLB will be more efficient in terms of hits

Larger pages are likely to cause issues with regards to fragmentation, where we'd be likely to use large pages for small stack sizes, etc.
And we are wasting memory. This limits the total amount of possible running processes. 

Multi Level pages are here to save the day.

MLPs are made of pages and a page directory. The page directory is the size of a single page. 

In MLPs, the virtual page number (VPN) is formed of two different values, a andb.
a determines the entry within the page directory, which references a page table
b references in entry for a page table, which references a page.

On the bad side, MLPs make an extra memory reference for each lookup than regular page tables.
This makes the TLB an even more important aspect of the whole dealio.

On the good side, this implies less fragmentation

There is still some waste for the unused parts of the address space.
