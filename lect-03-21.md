# OS Memory - The big picture


haikus on the memory model

For each process,
There's a page directory
Which points to PTs         // page tables

The kernel process,
In physical memory:
Lower addresses             // kernel stuff lives in lower memory addresses

After, a bitmap             
Showing available space,
n <- page_alloc(), page_free(n)   // after the kernel space, a bitmap keeps track of free pages

Expand heap with brk(),
Kernel inspect address space
If success, page_alloc()          // if you run malloc() and your heap isn't big enough, it calls brk() which can 

malloc() on [data],
don't forget to free mallocs()
or [data] gets BIG                // this is the idea behind the memory leak. It's just a program that keeps getting bigger, and 
                                  // can be solved by killing the process. That's not necessarily what you want. 


How does fork() work?

A naive fork() call
Will copy the address space,
copy the PTs
copy the data,
copy the heap and the stack,
and use twice the mem              // A naive fork will just do a deep copy and will use twice the memory previously emplyed by the
                                   // previous process. This is bad since the new process will get overwritten anyway by the call to
                                   // exec(). So we can optimize things.
                                   
A new call to fork()
With new page directory,
and its page tables
will have its PTs
Pointing to the old pages
of the old process                  // 

All the old pages
The new process can just read
But if write it breaks
The fork() will then get
new pages the process can write
to without segfaults
